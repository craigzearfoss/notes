# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures
- Starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
- It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search.
- It would be implemented like a stack, whereas a depth-first search would be implemented as a queue.
- Class: **Search algorithm**
- Data structure: **Graph**
- Worst-case performance: O(|V| + |E|) = O(b^d)
- Worst-case space complexity: O(|V|) = O(b^d)
